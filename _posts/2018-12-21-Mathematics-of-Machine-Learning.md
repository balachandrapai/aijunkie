Machine learning is all about creating an algorithm that can learn from the data to make a prediction. Do you need to know math to do machine learning? Yes! The big 4 math disciplines that make up machine learning are linear algebra, probability theory, calculus, and statistics. Machine learning is built on these mathematical prerequisites.
